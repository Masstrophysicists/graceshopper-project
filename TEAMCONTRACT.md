# Project: GraceShopper

_An e-commerce app for adults_

This document describes our team social contract for this project

## Team Members:

- Sean Kutash
- Emily Paye
- Frank Latino
- Chris Almodovar
- Steven Davis

## Roles:

- Taskmaster
- Gitmaster
- Testmaster

## Daily Process:

- Morning standup started by the last Taskmaster (11:30 AM)
- New roles assigned (by the last Taskmaster)
- What did we accomplish Yesterday? What's the plan for Today? Are there any Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
- Pair program on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates, and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable Pull Requests, review each other’s code and merge into master

## Team Expectations:

- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project.
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Share the mic
- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on

## Issues:

- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  1. Take 10-15 minute break
  2. List out the pros / cons
  3. Vote on it
  4. If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
- If you are frustrated:
  - Take a walk or get some water
  - Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  - Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
