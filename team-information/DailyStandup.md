Goal:

Should be short (~15 minutes or less)

Each person in round robin style:

What did I do yesterday?
We set up our git workflow and assigned team roles

What am I doing today?
Couple of people working on creating the database and its items.
(Emily and Steven)

Couple of people to investigate postgresqls data constraints to ensure data integrity.
(Sean)

Couple of people to write express routes in conjunction with postgresql to verify backend requests.
(Frank and Chris)

Do I have any blockers?

Blocker: something outside of your control that is preventing you from making progress on the thing youâ€™re doing today
