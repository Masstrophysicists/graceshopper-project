Goal:
Continue with  Tier 1 requirements, add dummy data into db.

Should be short (~15 minutes or less)

Each person in round robin style:

What did I do yesterday?
Steven and Emily: Created two more models, Order and OderItem, adjusted item model integer property. Created db associations and had Morgan double check. Updated db/index.js, began dummy data insertion.

Chris, Frank, Sean:
Yesterday completed Item Model, set up routes for adding editing, removing items, created front end for the items page, and backend for serving items to the front end.


What am I doing today?
Steven and Emily: Finish db and dummy data,



Do I have any blockers?
Frank's Database connection needs to be debugged


Blocker: something outside of your control that is preventing you from making progress on the thing youâ€™re doing today
