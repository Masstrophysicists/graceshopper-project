Goal:
Continue with  Tier 1 requirements, add dummy data into db, figure out JWT authorization.

Should be short (~15 minutes or less)

Each person in round robin style:

What did I do yesterday?
Steven and Emily: Created two more models, Order and OderItem, adjusted item model integer property. Created db associations and had Morgan double check. Updated db/index.js, began dummy data insertion.

Chris, Frank, Sean:

What am I doing today?
Steven and Emily: Finish db and dummy data,


Do I have any blockers?
Frank's Database connection needs to be debugged
JWT Authorization is failing, needs to be investigated.

Blocker: something outside of your control that is preventing you from making progress on the thing youâ€™re doing today
